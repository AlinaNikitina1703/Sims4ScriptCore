by Keyofrassilon

## Requirements
You will need to have ControlAnySim installed
https://github.com/TitanNano/TS4ControlAnySim

It is recommended you are using more buyable venues from LittleMsSam

Not entirely sure but the base game might be the only requirement as far as Sims 4 is concerned.
## About the Mod
The Sims4ScriptCore mod is written in python and tuning files. In game, this mod accessed through a menu system
by clicking on any sim, floor, or object will allow the user to call cheats or commands with a few clicks of the
mouse. You can transport multiple Sims at one time instantly, copy & paste individual articles of clothing from one
sim to another, summon a lightning strike, play with time, change the weather, and so much more. Want to find
out how? Let’s get started.

## Installation
Follow these easy steps to get the mod:
1. Click on the following link to download the zip file from Github:
https://github.com/keyofrassilon/Sims4ScriptCore
2. Click on the green “Code” button on the upper right side of the page to pull down the dropdown window.
3. Click on “Download Zip” on the bottom of the dropdown window.
Unzip the file using Winrar, Winzip or any other similar program. Move the Sims4ScriptCore-main folder, which
contains the package files and the script folder directly to your mods folder no further than one level down. Some
unzip programs create an additional folder with the same filename to unzip into looking like this: Sims4ScriptCore-
main/Sims4ScriptCore-main/files. This will cause the script folder to be two levels deep inside your Mods folder.
To avoid this from happening simply copy and paste the subfolder Sims4ScriptCore-main/files into your Mods
folder.
Please note: Inside the Sims4ScriptCore-main folder, there contains package files and a subfolder with .py files.
These .py python files are the uncompiled and unzipped .ts4script files that the game still recognizes. Thus, there
is no need to alter them before adding them to your game. In this form, they are completely editable and open
source without any further manipulation as it was always intended to be.
When the installation is complete, its address should look like this: Sims4\Mods\Sims4ScriptCore
